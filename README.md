# Space Game

**Space Game** is a top-down 2D puzzle game centered around environmental interaction. This project was built by teaming up with a group of peers to bring this game to life, combining our different skills to create something we're proud of.
The game starts you off as a crew member aboard an abandoned spaceship, your mission is to explore the ship, solve intricate puzzles, and repair its critical systems. Your ultimate goal is to collect four keycards that grant access to the cockpit, allowing you to regain full control of the ship and complete the game.
